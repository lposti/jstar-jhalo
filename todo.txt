1) risolviamo il problema dello scatter
2) asseriamo che e' un problm intrinseco di LCDM
3) non ne parliamo: fermarsi a sez. 3 e magari esplorare i dettagli (tipo variare shmr). Ad esempio Dutton+2010

Abstract:
The ratio between the amount of specific angular momentum that today is in the
stellar components of galaxies with respect to that stored in the dark matter halo,
$f_j \equiv j_\ast/j_h$, encapsulates much information on how the galaxy formed.
This ratio, also known as retained fraction of angular momentum, is today equal
to $1$ if galaxy formation has on average conserved the angular momentum of the
initial protogalaxy, or smaller than $1$ if some angular momentum was dissipated.
We use cosmologically-motivated models to study this ratio across a wide range
in halo masses, $10.5 \leq \log M_h/M_\odot \leq 14$, and for different galaxy
morphological types separately, i.e. late-type and early-type galaxies.
One key ingredient of our model is the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR)
$M_\ast=M_\ast(M_h)$ which assumes the abundance matching ansatz and is constrained
by galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy clustering and galaxy number density.
We constrain our models with either state-of-the-art measurements of the stellar
specific angular momentum or with recent estimates of galactic scaling laws such
as the Tully-Fisher, Faber-Jackson, mass-size and Fundamental Plane.
We find that in order to make realistic galaxies, which simultaneously adhere
on such well-studied correlations, it is \emph{inevitable} that $f_j$ must vary
sensibly with halo mass other than with morphological type. Such variation mimics,
and it is in fact its reflection of, the behaviour of the observed stellar fraction
$f_\ast \equiv M_\ast/M_h$ as a function of halo mass: galaxies with haloes of
$M_h \lesssim 10^{12} M_\odot$ are less efficient at forming stars and retain less
angular momentum during galaxy formation, as well as galaxies with haloes of
$M_h \gtrsim 10^{12} M_\odot$. Any galaxy formation model which is bound to a $f_\ast$
peaking at about $M_h \sim 10^{12} M_\odot$ must employ a mass-varying retained
fraction of angular momentum in order to produce realistic late- and early-type
galaxies today.



The formation of galaxies from initial proto-galactic hot gas clouds is a strongly
dissipative process which, in the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM)
framework, is guided by the hierarchy of mergers of the extended
dark matter haloes in which they reside \citep[see e.g.,][]{WhiteRees78}. While
gas is cooling, dissipating energy ($E$) and therefore being accumulated in dense
regions close to the centre of the halo's potential well, its initial total angular
momentum ($J$) is typically retained in this process leading to the formation of a cold,
thin, rotating and star-forming disc.
Many studies have indeed shown that with this first-order approximation of
conservation of total angular momentum, one is able to predict the general behaviour
of some observed scaling laws in the nearby Universe \citep[see][]{Fall83,Dalcanton+1997,
MMW98}

At the early stages of structure collapse, the dark halo/protogalactic cloud system
acquires spin from the tidal torques exerted by the surrounding structures \citep[][]
{Hoyle1949,Peebles69}. Hence, prior to the collapse of gas in the potential well
of the dark halo, the baryons and dark matter had the same angular momentum per unit
mass, i.e. the same specific angular momentum
\begin{equation}
j_\ast=\jh,
\end{equation}
where $j_\ast=J_\ast/M_\ast$ is the ratio between angular momentum and mass of the
proto-galaxy\footnote{
In this work we focus on the role of the stellar angular momentum under the working
assumption that they keep the same angular momentum of the gas from which they formed.
So even if the proto-galactic cloud contains no star, the initial spin of stars and
gas is the same.
} and $\jh=J_{\rm h}/\Mh$ is that of the halo \citep[see][]{FallEfstathiou1980}.

In standard $\Lambda$CDM, dark matter haloes are homologous structures and therefore
any property of the halo is known by knowing its mass $\Mh$ and the global scaling
of that property with mass for the halo population. In particular, more massive
haloes are bigger in size and have larger circular velocities, therefore they
also have larger specific angular momenta and specifically the $\log\jh-\loh\Mh$
relation turns out to be linear \citet[][hereafter RF12]{RF12}. This mostly reflects
the fact that more massive haloes are larger and not that the orbits of their particles
are more circular: indeed if following \cite{Peebles1969} one defines a dimensionless
parameter aimed at quantifying the rotation rate of self-gravitating bodies as
\begin{equation}
\label{def:lambda}
\lambda \equiv \frac{J\,|E|^{1/2}}{G\,M^{5/2}},
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the gravitational constant, one immediately realises, e.g. from
linear tidal torque theory or numerical simulations, that it is virtually
independent on halo mass ({\lp Barnes and Efstathiou 1987 and Efstathiou?})

The physics of galaxies is instead more complicated and smaller galaxies are not
scaled down versions of larger ones. However, many scaling laws are konwn to
exist between e.g. the total luminosity and rotational velocities of spiral galaxies
{\lp (Tully-Fisher)} or the velocity dispersion of ellipticals {\lp (Faber-Jackson)},
the surface brightness and effective radius ({\rm Kormendy}). Recently, many
authors have started to investigate observationally the specific angular
momentum-mass of galaxies, starting from \citetalias{RF12} who
focused on stars in a sample of well resolved nearby galaxies, then
\cite{ObreschkowGlazebrook14} who measured angular momenta of cold gas from
high quality HI observations, then \cite{Cortese+16} who observed both stellar
and gas rotation in the local Universe for a large sample of galaxies, to
\cite{Burkert+16} and \cite{Harrison+17} who measured gas rotations from H$\alpha$
observations at $z\simeq 1$. All these works agree that the $\log j_\ast-\log M_\ast$
is a linear relation with slope similar to that of the dark matter haloes (and
virtually insensitive on redshift up to $z=1$).
